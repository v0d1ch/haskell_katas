### Haskell Katas

As I try to learn Haskell, I realized reading and following examples is not enough, I needed short examples I could practice daily.

The examples in this repo are mostly from the book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

The `master` branch has the passing examples, and the [ad-exercices](https://github.com/adomokos/haskell_katas/tree/ad-exercises) branch has the incomplete examples you need to implement.

You need [HSpec](https://hspec.github.io/) installed globally to run the examples.

Enjoy!
